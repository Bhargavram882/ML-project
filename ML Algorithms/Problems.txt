Use CIFAR-10 Dataset and compare the following ML algorithms.
a. Support Vector Machine
b. Random Forests
c. Decision Tree
d. Logistic Regression
2. Use Train-test split as 80% Train and 20% test.
3. Print the train and test error for your model.
4. Finally, to gain an understanding of how your models are performing, please score each
model against three metrics: Precision, Recall and Accuracy.
5. Plot ROC curve for each model for the comparison of results.
a. State which ML model is best among the given models based on ROC curve analysis.
